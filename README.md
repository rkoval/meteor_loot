LOOT (**L**earning **O**pportunities **O**n **T**uesday) Session given on Meteor

Basically a regurgitation of [the official Meteor tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/try), but tuned to fit into a section of an hour-long presentation. 

Demo of this tutorial was given by using `git checkout master~#`, where # is the number of steps back you want to get to. After each step, the next step would be checked out and diffed to display to the attendees. See [talking_notes.md](talking_notes.md) for my talking notes during the demo.. they might be indecipherable, but they're there for reference!

Finally, [Meteor.pptx](Meteor.pptx) is the summary presentation that I put together from the various sources listed in the final slide of the PowerPoint.
