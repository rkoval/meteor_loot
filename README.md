LOOT (Learning Opportunities On Tuesday) Session given on Meteor

Basically a regurgitation of [the official Meteor tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/try), but tuned to fit into a section of an hour-long presentation. 

Demo of this tutorial was given by using `git checkout master~#`, where # is the number of steps back you want to get to. After each step, the next step would be checked out and diffed to display to the attendees.

[Meteor.pptx](Meteor.pptx) is the summary presentation that I put together from the various sources listed in the final slide of the PowerPoint.
